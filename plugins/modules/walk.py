short_description: Perform an SNMP walk against a remote device for one or more OIDs
version_added: "1.0.0"
description:
  - Perform an SNMP walk against a remote device for one or more OIDs
options:
  best_guess:
    description:
    - This setting controls how return value oids are parsed.
    - Setting to 0 causes a regular lookup.
    - Setting to 1 causes a regular expression match (defined as -Ib in snmpcmd).
    - Setting to 2 causes a random access lookup (defined as -IR in snmpcmd).
    type: int
    choices:
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
    default: 0
  enums:
    description:
      - Set to `True` to have integer return values converted to enumeration identifiers if possible.
    type: bool
    default: True
  long_names:
    description:
      - Set to `True` to have OIDS generated preferring longer Mib name convention.
    type: bool
    default: False
  oids:
    description:
      - A dictionary of entries to walk on the remote device
    type: list
    elements: dict
    required: True
    suboptions:
      oid:
        description:
        - The OID to retrieve.
        type: str
        required: True
      iid:
        description:
        - the dotted-decimal, instance identifier, for scalar MIB objects use '0'
        type: str
  numeric:
    description:
      - Set to `True to have `oids` returned untranslated (i.e. dotted-decimal).
    type: bool
    default: False
  sprint_value:
    description:
      - Set to `True` to have return values formatted with netsnmp's sprint_value function.
      - This will result in certain data types being returned in non-canonical format.
      - Values returned with this option set may not be appropriate for 'set' operations.

    type: bool
    default: True
