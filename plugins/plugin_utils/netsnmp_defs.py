"""The SNMP v1 connection

Note:
  It is importtant that these class defintions stay in sync with
  their respective module and connection docstrings
  These classes are introspected for defautl and non-default values
  and the attributes are subsequently pulled from the
  connection options and task args
  The default values here are not used, but serve as an indication
  of whether or not the argspec value of None should be used
  as ansible provides None for an optional value in the argspec
  because the netsnmp Session cannot be updated with a None value
